Entities exist first
↓
Latent actors exist (hidden, not labeled)
↓
Interactions happen (transactions)
↓
Graph structure emerges
↓
Fraud behavior becomes visible ONLY in structure
↓
Labels assigned AFTER observing structure


point to remember
Fraud is not a property of merchants.
It is a property of interaction patterns.


Rules:
No entity is born fraud
No label influences generation
Fraud emerges only from interaction patterns
Labels are assigned with hindsight
ML never sees generator rules
